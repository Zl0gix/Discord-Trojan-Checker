# Discord-Trojan-Checker

This program is made to verify that your Discord or Discord PTB installation hasn't been corrupted by the AnarchyGrabber3 version found the 25/05/2020

The check is very simple and only consists of verifying the content of one file (if it contains more than one line, it is probably corrupted)

As I write this Readme :
- Discord's current version is 0.0.306
- Discord PTB's current version is 0.0.52
