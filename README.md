# Discord-Trojan-Checker

This program is made to verify that your Discord or Discord PTB installation hasn't been corrupted by the AnarchyGrabber3 version found the 25/05/2020

The check is very simple and only consists of verifying the content of one file. ([Source of the information](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/discord-client-turned-into-a-password-stealer-by-updated-malware/ "link to the web article"))

As I write this Readme :
- Discord's current version is 0.0.306
- Discord PTB's current version is 0.0.52

**To download** the executable file (Windows only), go to the ["Release" page of the project](https://github.com/Zl0gix/Discord-Trojan-Checker/releases "link to the Releases")
